# **Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy**
A Minecraft Terra pack that turns the entire world into a winter wonderland!

Hydraxia: A Winterland's Fantasy is a Terra world generation pack for Minecraft Java v1.19.2+ that completely changes the vanilla Minecraft Overworld generation! The entire world is themed to be in an eternal winter, however every single block and item (hopefully) can be obtained in survival in the default preset of this pack. This pack includes over 60 **unique** biomes to explore, including 29 cave biomes!

> **THIS PACK IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION YET**

Hydraxia is still in the playtesting stage, and balancing issues and bugs may be prevalent. As long as this warning is still here, this pack is not completed yet.
